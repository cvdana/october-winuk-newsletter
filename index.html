            <span class="hello">HELLO WINUK COMMUNITY,</span><br /><br />
            Gender disparity in STEM is very much a present issue where women
            still encounter resistance and need to navigate obstacles to get a
            space in this field. <br />Despite this, plenty of women broke
            through these barriers and significantly contributed to
            neuroscience.<br /><br />
            At WiNUK, we want to open these doors and acknowledge and promote
            women neuroscientists who made a contribution to research and
            inclusive workspaces. <br />That’s why we’ve come up with the WiNUK
            Awards, to be held in November 2024. We hope with this award
            ceremony we don’t only highlight amazing achievements in
            neuroscience but also serve as an inspiration for the next
            generation of women neuroscientists. Stay tuned not to miss
            anything!

            <h3>Psychedelics Event</h3>

            <p>
              We held our psychedelics event where we explored their role in
              neuroscience. Our speakers included Ms. Susan Guner, a holistic
              psychotherapist and host of the Psychedelics Conversations
              podcast, who shared insights into how psychedelics are helping
              those suffering from illness, Professor Emma Robinson, Professor
              of Psychopharmacology who explored her research on affective
              biases and emotional behaviour in rodents using psychedelic drugs,
              and Dr Danielle Kurtin a research fellow at Imperial College
              London who investigates the neural underpinnings of substance
              (mis)use/dependence.

              <h3>Pain Awareness Week Content</h3>
              <p>
                The team created content focused on Pain Awareness Week. Neave
                attended the international pain conference in Amsterdam,
                highlighting current discussions and advancements in pain
                management. Additionally, senior Content Creator Katie reviewed
                "Empire of Pain" by Patrick Keefe. This book explores the
                controversial history of Purdue Pharma and its opioid,
                OxyContin, shedding light on its medical and societal
                implications.
                <br />Neave designed a graphic and social media post discussing
                sex differences in the context of pain, aiming to raise
                awareness and foster understanding.

                Lizzie participated in the Early Career Researchers Day at the
                University of Plymouth. She gave a talk on creating inclusive
                workplaces, which received positive feedback for its practical
                insights and inclusive approach. Lizzie also served as a judge
                for the event's Early Career Researcher talks and poster
                sessions, further contributing to the advancement of research
                and inclusivity in the field.

                  EV characterization through Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis
                  (NTA), determining particle size and concentration
                </li>

                  EV modification via Electroporation for therapeutic cargo
                  loading
                </li>
                <li>
                  The application of these modified EVs in a cell model of
